Hot Issues
==========

Blogger Support
---------------
Google has sunset the legacy login methods used by Windows Live Writer and Open Live Writer (0.5.0).

Open Live Writer 0.5.1.2 adds a new login method (OAuth 2 compliant), so that now Blogger users can log in.

Since Blogger API on categories/tags has also changed, Open Live Writer is being updated to work well with the new API.

.. note:: The YouTube related feature is also being worked on to adapt to Google's changes.

OS X/Linux Port
---------------
It has been discussed roughly and the current task is to identify cross platform friendly portions.

For Windows specific components, they will have to be rewritten for OS X and Linux.

`A GitHub issue <https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/issues/50>`_ has been created to track the OS X port.

Similarly, `a GitHub issue <https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/issues/46>`_ has been created for Linux port.

Of course, even for Windows there is `a discussion <https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/issues/158>`_ about whether to port it to UWP.
